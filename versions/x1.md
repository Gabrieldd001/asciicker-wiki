# X1 Website title: ASCIICKER - rendering simple heightmap with 3 characters: ,';

## Description
Possibly the beginning of Asciicker (Tell me if there is something more older than X1). It features primitive green hills and an early click to rotate button. It features the grid lines, which are made with the characters: comma, apostrophe, and semicolon (, ’ ;). It also appears that the terrain is randomly generated every time the version is loaded.

## Date
This version according to https://asciicker.com/x1/fonts/cp437_8x8.png, dates back to 2016-03-23 10:45. With the other fonts dating to 2017-09-07 with the times being around 11:13 to 11:15. Confirmed by gumix, asciicker has not started in 2016.

## Bugs:
Using the zoom in feature doesn’t actually change the font size, it instead zooms it in and makes it blurry. Despite having a /fonts folder with 7 fonts.
